/*

To find the shortest path that visits all three given nodes in a binary tree, you will need to find the common meeting node (which may be one of the given nodes or an ancestor of them) that minimizes the total distance to all three nodes. This common meeting node will be on the path from one node to the other two nodes and is known as the "Lowest Common Ancestor" (LCA) in the context of two nodes.

Here, we need to extend the concept of LCA to include three nodes, which means finding two LCAs: one for any two of the nodes, and then using the result to find the LCA with the third node.

The total distance will be the sum of the distances from the common meeting node to each of the three nodes.

The algorithm will involve three main steps:

Find the LCA of two of the nodes.
Find the LCA of the third node and the LCA found in step 1.
Calculate the distances from the LCA found in step 2 to each of the three nodes and sum them up.


This code assumes the tree is a binary tree and not necessarily a binary search tree, and that all node values are unique. The function findShortestPath calculates the distance of the shortest path that visits all three nodes. If the nodes do not exist in the tree, the behavior is undefined; you would need to add additional checks to handle such cases properly.
