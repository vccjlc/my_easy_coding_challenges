/*

you are given a tree and a list. Check if the list corresponds to some upward path in the tree


To check if a given list corresponds to some upward path in the tree, you can start by searching for the leaf node that matches the last element of the list, as an upward path in a tree would end at a leaf node. Once you find such a leaf, you can trace upwards from the leaf to the root and compare each node's value with the corresponding element in the list. The list corresponds to an upward path in the tree if all elements match during this upward traversal, and the first element of the list matches with a node that has no parent (indicating the start of the path at a leaf node or somewhere along a branch if the list does not start from the actual root of the tree).
