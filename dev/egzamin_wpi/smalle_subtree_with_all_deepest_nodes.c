/*

Given the root of a binary tree, the depth of each node is the shortest distance to the root.

Return the smallest subtree such that it contains all the deepest nodes in the original tree.

A node is called the deepest if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree.

The subtree of a node is a tree consisting of that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.



To find the smallest subtree containing all the deepest nodes of a binary tree, you need to identify the nodes with the maximum depth first and then find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all these deepest nodes. The LCA of the deepest nodes will be the root of the smallest subtree that contains all the deepest nodes.

The algorithm works as follows:

Traverse the tree to find the maximum depth.
Traverse the tree again to find the LCA of all nodes at this maximum depth.
